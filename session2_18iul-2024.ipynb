My comments are organized according to paragraphs in Bureau\\u2019s Proposal. OBJECTIVES (P ARAGRAPH 7 ) I support the FCITC\\u2019s inclusion of a clear statement of its objectives . However, I recommend that the objectives be limited in number because the more numerous the objectives , the more likely they are to conflict and more difficult to attain . Narrowing the number focus es attention and offers better chance of success. I recommend the following as the FCITC\\u2019s overarching objective : The objective of the FCITC is t o strengthen international tax cooperation among Member States in terms of its inclusiveness and effectiveness , in both substance and process , while respecting where feasible national tax sovereignty . My proposed objective inserts the phase \\u201cwhere feasible \\u201d 1 as a qualifier to national sovereignty . My reason is that unrestricted tax sovereignty by one or more countries could have large negative spillovers on other countries and impair the FCITC\\u2019s effectiveness and inclusivity. Thus, some losses in tax sovereignty may be justified by gains in FCITC effectiveness and inclusivity. PRINCIPLES (P ARAGRAPHS 8 -9) I also support paragraph 8 . The FCITC should provide a clear list, with definitions, of the fundamental principles that would satisfy its objective or objectives . However, my concern with the bullet list in paragraph 9 is the number. While each item (and with sub- items) has validity on its own , there is no prioritization , the principles are likely to be in conflict, and some principles would be better met through other UN protocols . Instead, the FCITC should limit principles to those closely tied to its objective. For example, d ecomposing my recommended FCITC objective, the principles should : \\u2022 Strengthen inclusiveness in (i) substance and (ii) process \\u2022 Strengthen effectiveness in (i) substance and (ii) process 1 Adjunct Professor of Law and Professor Emerita of Management, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, leden@tamu.edu . My comments on UN (2024) are provided in my personal capacity and do not represent the opinions of my employer or other organizations with which I am affiliated . This submission with endnotes and references is available for download at: https://www.voxprof.com/eden/eden -publications -tp-tax.html . Lorraine Eden, Zero Draft TOR Comments (21 June 2024) | 2 \\u2022 Respect, where feasible, national tax sovereignty . Effectiveness and inclusiveness in substance a nd process should next be defined . Those definitions should embody the FCITC\\u2019s principles and be used to assess its success. The prescriptive school of public finance 2 can offer useful advice to selection of principles because it takes a hands -on approach committed to applying theory to real world problems that have real- world constraints . The prescriptive school argues that tax architecture and tax engineering should select taxes appropriate for a country\\u2019s economic and cultural conditions and institutions . As a result, the tax policy mix and tax rates will differ across countries .3 At the international level, the objective of international tax cooperation should reflect tax principles such as international and inter -nation equity, efficiency4 and/or neutrality , transparency, and administrative feasibility. P olicymakers must recognize the difficulties of putting principles into practice , given they are likely to conflict ; opt for policy solutions that can be implemented in a world of mobile capital; and take account of differences across countries in their economic and social conditions and institutions.5 This last point is especially helpful in terms of creating a FCITC that is both inclusive and effective but also respects national tax sovereignty . Differences across countries matter and should be taken into account. My recommendation s, building on WTO practices , are : \\u2022 The FCITC should include a \\u201cSpecial and Differential Treatment\\u201d section, where the least developed countries that sign the FCITC are given a longer time period , with a fixed endpoint , to meet their commitments. 6 \\u2022 Similar to preferential trading agreements , coalitions of like-minded signatories should be permitted to move faster , deeper and broader than FCITC commitments . \\u2022 Member States that refuse to meet FCITC commitments should be excluded from the FCITC and its benefits . 7 SUBSTANTIVE AREAS (P ARAGRAPHS 10, 14 AND 15 ) In terms of the FCITC\\u2019s substantive areas, I considered the three paragraphs together since they all deal with substantive elements . 8 I regrouped them into six topics and recommend focusing on the first three in the short term : \\u2022 transparency (10.4, 15.2) \\u2022 harmful tax practices (15.4) and tax-related illicit financial flows (14.3) \\u2022 taxing MNE profits in the digital economy (10.1, 14.1) and cross -border services (14.2) \\u2022 taxing high -net worth individuals (10.2, 14.5) \\u2022 dispute settlement (10.5, 14,4, 15.3) \\u2022 taxes for environmental concerns (10.3, 15.1) Substantive area #1: Transparency Transparency is a fundamental \\u201cbuilding block\\u201d of a good tax system. More transparency increases the Lorraine Eden, Zero Draft TOR Comments (21 June 2024) | 3 likelihood of achieving other tax principles because it encourages compliance . Transparency \\u201cshines the light in the dark corners\\u201d, identifying and discourag ing illegal practices. Transparency builds trust , which fosters trade, FDI, and economic development . MNEs should provide greater transparency on their ownership, activities and finances . This would also benefit substantive area #2 (harmful tax practices and t ax-related illicit financial flows ). Governments should also provide transparency in terms of their governance and management of national tax systems . Greater transparency would discourage government corruption, build trust in tax systems, enhance tax morale, encourage inward FDI, discourage illicit outflows, and increase domestic revenue s.9 The FCITC should adopt the following transparency norms for MNEs and governments : \\u2022 Multilateral automatic exchange of information among tax authorities of financial information including financial accounts and other asset classes .10 \\u2022 A UN public registry of beneficial ownership information of companies, trusts, partnerships, and other legal entities . \\u2022 Public reporting 11 by MNEs at the company level on a country -by-country basis, including financial and tax data, economic activities, and intra- group transactions . \\u2022 A UN public registry of national tax policies and practices, with attention to harmful tax practices, secrecy provisions, and low or no effective tax rates. Substantive area # 2: Harmful tax practices and tax -related illicit financial flows I do not believe there is anything fundamentally wrong with the residence and source principles; however, comparisons of the OECD and UN model tax conventions 12 point to the greater importance of source -based taxes to developing countries, in terms of the corporate income tax ( CIT) and withholding taxes. My recommendations , therefore, are to ( i) build on the MLI, (ii) make a \\u201cback to basics\\u201d renewed commitment to international tax principles , and (iii) broaden UN protocols to cover tax . Building on the MLI Historically, bilateral tax treaties (BTTs) have been the primary method by which governments have applied the residence and source principles to different sources of MNE cross -border income. 13 Frequent criticisms of BTTs are that (i) preventing double taxation has been their primary goal while double non-taxation has been ignored; (ii) BTTs favor capital- exporting (residence) countries at the expense of capital -importing (source) countries 14; and (iii) the \\u201c BTTs spaghetti bowl\\u201d has created tax loopholes that have encouraged significant base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) activities by MNEs.15 After the 2 007-2009 global financial crisis16, governments realized that multilateral, not bilateral, efforts were needed to counteract BEPS activities . The OECD\\u2019s BEPS project resulted in 15 Action Items , some of which were implemented through the BEPS Multilateral Instrument (MLI). The MLI was designed to apply alongside a country\\u2019s existing BTTs and modify them by allowing the signatories to adopt the action item without having to renegotiate their BTT. However, the problem to date has been that many governments (including the US) have not signed the MLI and those that have signed, have opted out of many provisions.17 Lorraine Eden, Zero Draft TOR Comments (21 June 2024) | 4 The MLI, although not an unqualified success , still provide s a useful model for multilateral tax cooperation.18 The FCITC sh ould also take a multilateral , flexible, \\u201cfast track\\u201d approach that : \\u2022 enable s revising multiple BTTs at the same time ; \\u2022 adds or revises clauses that benefit developing countries ; and \\u2022 encourage s BTTs between developed and developing countries. Back to basic principles Aggressive tax practices by MNEs in the globalized digital economy have encouraged large financial flows \\u2013 legal and illicit \\u2013 into tax havens and investment hubs. Transfer pricing has often been blamed as the primary cause of BEPS activities, with recommendations that the arm\\u2019s length principle (ALP) be replaced with global formulary apportionment (GFA) . \\u201cAnti-ALP\\u201d views have had some success ; e.g., OECD Pillar One Amount A would replace the ALP with GFA to allocate some profits of the largest MNEs to market jurisdictions . 19 However, blaming profit shifting on transfer pricing is akin to \\u201cshooting the messenger .\\u201d 20 The cause lies elsewhere. The problem is not transfer pricing but loopholes in the international tax regime, often placed there by governments , that encourage BEPS behaviors . 21 The solution is to fix the loopholes, not discard the ALP or replace it with the unprincipled method of GFA. The FCITC should re-commit to : \\u2022 basic tax principles of residence , source , separate entity, and ALP; \\u2022 ensuring that profits are declared where MNE activities take place and value is created ; and \\u2022 source countries having \\u201cfirst crack\\u201d rights to MNE profits using CIT and withholding taxes .22 Expanding UN protocols to cover tax Existing UN protocols could be expanded to cover BEPS activities. For example, the UN Global Compact23 consists of 10 corporate sustainability principles. P rinciple #10 is anti-corruption : \\u201cBusinesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery .\\u201d I propose revising its last clause as: \\u201c\\u2026, including extortion, bribery, abusive tax practices , and tax -related illicit financial flows .\\u201d MNEs that sign the Global Compact would then commit to avoiding abusive and illicit tax practices. Substantive area # 3: Taxing MNE profits in the digital economy and cross -border services A core problem that still needs attention , despite Pillars One and Two , is BEPS Action Item 1: T axing the Digital Economy.24 I have three recommendations: A 21st century definition of a permanent establishment (PE) Governments need a 21st century \\u201c fit for purpose\\u201d definition of the permanent establishment (PE), one that provide s nexus to countries where digital activities take place so their governments can levy CITs and/or withholding taxes on those profits . In my view, the problem is how to determine when digital activities are sufficiently permanent in a host country that governments and MNEs agree that the activities constitute inward FDI , and not trade flows. Lorraine Eden, Zero Draft TOR Comments (21 June 2024) | 5 As an example, should digital flows from country A to country B be classified as B \\u2019s imports (so the appropriate tax by B is a customs duty or import services tax ) or as inputs to the production process ( a VAT) or as inward FDI ( a PE with nexus for CIT and withholding taxes )? ICSID\\u2019s definition of FDI (the Salini test) may be helpful here.25 DSTs and cross -border services A PE definition that covers digital FDI would also help with DSTs and taxing income from cross -border digital services . Even if Pillar One Amount A were adopted, it is highly unlikely that DSTs \\u2013 whether digital sales taxes or digital services taxes \\u2013 will wither away. DSTs are a relatively easy and attractive source of tax revenue, especially for countries that have difficulty collecting income taxes . A benefit of creating a PE definition that covers digital flows and activities would be easier separation of: \\u2022 Digital FDI : Firms have a PE and nexus in the source country so pay CIT and withholding taxes. \\u2022 Digital trade: F irms export digital goods and services , where a tariff, DST or VAT on imports is the appropriate revenue -raising policy by the market jurisdiction . International tax cooperation for the FDI group belongs to the domain of the FCITC . Tax cooperation for the trade group typically belongs at the WTO under the GATT (digital goods and electronic transmissions) . MNE cross -border services (e.g., automated digital services) may fall under both the GATS and the FCITC since services are often intertwined with FDI . Separating FDI (where residence and source principles apply) from international trade (where origin and destination principles apply) would be much easier with a PE definition that defines what is and what is not digital FDI. Transfer pricing in the digital economy Lastly , taxing the digital economy also requires the development of transfer pricing guidelines for 21 st century firms and activities. UN (2021) should include a chapter on \\u201cTransfer Pricing of Digital Transactions .\\u201d 26 The chapter should cover digital business models (e.g., digital platforms, automated digital services, Internet of Things, 3D printing , etc.), accurate delineation of the digital transaction or activity , comparability analysis, and application of transfer pricing method s. Respectfully submitted by Lorraine Eden, PhD leden@tamu.edu 21 June 2024\",\n          \"Written comments of Belgium on the Bureau\\u2019s Proposal for the Zero Draft Terms of Reference for a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. \\uf0b7 Belgium remains a strong advocate of effective multilateralism in the international community. We wish to reiterate our sincere commitment to the objectives of inclusive, fair and effective international tax cooperation. \\uf0b7 We refer to the common position on behalf of the European Union and its Member States of 25 April 2024 that was presented as a general statement during the first substantive session in New York. This position outlines our guiding principles for a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation, which we also want to see reflected in the terms of reference for this convention. \\uf0b7 Our comments are based on the desire to promote an efficient and effective process at the UN level in the area of international tax cooperation that will help us to promote stability and reliability within the international tax architecture. In this context, the terms of reference for a UN framework convention on international tax cooperation are crucial to clarify and determine the governance structure to guide future work, including high-level commitments and procedural rules. Additionally, we hope that the Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) will strive to build bridges, find common ground, and foster mutual understanding. \\uf0b7 In general, there is a need for greater clarity on the procedures that will be followed by the negotiating committee in the terms of reference, similar to what has been done in other UN processes.1 We reiterate the importance of consensus-based decision making and this should clearly be reflected in the terms of reference. Consensus should be required in the negotiation and adoption of the text of the framework convention and its protocols, as well as for the work of the Ad Hoc Committee, with the objective of achieving a generally accepted result. \\uf0b7 We stress that developing early protocols in parallel to the negotiation of the framework convention remains an open issue to be further discussed by UN Member States. 1 Cf. Numbers 17-19 of UNGA Resolution 72/249 on an International legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Furthermore, we recall the wording used in the report of the Secretary General on Promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the United Nations,: \\u201cIf there is sufficient agreement on certain action items, some of these protocols could be negotiated at the same time as the framework convention. \\u201d This option was merely suggested as a possible course of action and should be reflected as such in the draft terms of reference. We strongly prefer that only a limited number of early protocols be developed after the negotiations of the framework convention are concluded. Therefore, we propose the following amendment to the draft terms of reference: \\u201cEarly protocols on a small number of specific priority areas could be developed after the negotiation of the framework convention.\\u201d \\uf0b7 We recommend that the negotiation of any such protocols be completed within a reasonable timeframe after concluding the negotiations of the framework convention. The timeframe to be foreseen for the negotiations of early protocols will depend on the number of protocols and on the subjects they cover. There should not be a single deadline for finalising all substantive protocols. The topics of protocols should focus on areas with the broadest consensus and agreement, therefore, least controversial topics, avoiding issues that are already under negotiation or those with internationally agreed standards. Therefore, it is appropriate to first conduct an assessment and discuss an exhaustive analysis of a small number of issues and prioritise certain topics over others. \\uf0b7 The proposed timeline in the zero draft terms of reference, which suggests that the intergovernmental negotiating committee should begin negotiating the early protocols, while also starting negotiations of the framework convention, will place excessive demands on Member States\\u2019 resources. \\uf0b7 Throughout its work, the intergovernmental negotiating committee should avoid duplicating the work of other relevant forums. It should consider potential synergies and leverage the existing tools, strengths, expertise and complementarities of the multiple institutions and processes involved in tax cooperation at the international, regional and local levels. \\uf0b7 The commitments mentioned in the zero draft should be high-level, illustrative, and complementary to already existing commitments. Therefore we would suggest including domestic resource mobilization, capacity building and fostering tax compliance. \\uf0b7 Considering the lack of a common understanding of certain concepts of the draft terms of reference among UNMS to date, there is a need to delineate these concepts in the terms of reference, for instance \\u2018tax-related illicit financial flows\\u2019. Guiding notes on this or other unclear concepts or topics should be prepared for the second session of the Committee. \\uf0b7 The terms of reference should reflect that they do not prejudge the outcomes of the negotiating committee and should clarify that the work of the negotiating committee should be based on substantive technical analysis before starting to work on any potential measures in a targeted and efficient manner. In addition, other instruments besides protocols should be explored (e.g. best practices or soft law). \\uf0b7 Belgium looks forward to working with the secretariat and the other Member States and stakeholders to create a stronger and more inclusive international tax system and we are very thankful for the opportunity to participate in shaping this new global instrument. -----------------------\",\n          \"Comentarios por escrito al borrador cero de T \\u00e9rminos de Referencia para una Convenci\\u00f3n Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre Cooperaci\\u00f3n Fiscal Internacional.

Written comments on the zero draft Terms of Reference for a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. Contributions from the Argentine Delegation Courtesy translation It is requested to kindly consider the following inputs: i. In order to facilitate its adoption in a timely manner, it is suggested that the Terms of Reference do not include the section relating to the substantial elements that the Member States undertake to include in the Framework Convention, on which there is no clear uniformity of criterion. ii. It is suggested that the terms of reference do not contain the section on specific priority areas to be addressed by additional protocols, since there is no global agreement on the priority nature of the substantial issues identified in the draft that would require the development of additional protocols that must be negotiated simultaneously with the Framework Convention. iii. Taking into account the differences in the capacities of the countries, and in order to provide them with timely and efficient support so that they can face this process, it is considered to extend the deadline for negotiating the text of the Framewor k Convention until the end of 2027. iv. Taking into account what was stated in section (ii), it is considered that no mention should be made regarding the deadline for the negotiation of additional simultaneous protocols to be finalized. However, if its development is decided, for the reason s stated in section (iii), the period should be much longer, that is, 2 years after the completion of the text of the Framework Convention. v. In relation to paragraph 13, no objections are raised in principle, given that the elements contained therein seem prima facie to be expected in a Convention such as the one that is going to be negotiated. In fact, several of these already appear, for e xample, in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters negotiated under the framework of the OECD and the Council of Europe, of which our country has been a party since 2012. vi.

Ainsi, une coop\\u00e9ration fiscale internationale devrait aborder les m\\u00e9canismes qui donneraient \\u00e0 la convention un caract\\u00e8re contraignant. \\u25aa La Convention -cadre devrait s\\u2019inscrire dans un esprit de co -d\\u00e9veloppement et de collaboration internationale dans l\\u2019int\\u00e9r\\u00eat commun de l\\u2019ensemble des Etats membres pour s\\u2019assurer que les solutions soient acceptables et applicables par les Etats membres . \\u25aa Les r\\u00e8gles instaur\\u00e9es dans le cadre de la Convention -cadre de l\\u2019ONU devraient garantir une participation significative, sur un pied d\\u2019\\u00e9galit\\u00e9 de tous les Etats membres, au processus de prise de d\\u00e9cisions. Les r\\u00e8gles et proc\\u00e9dures appliqu\\u00e9es aux travaux de l\\u2019Assembl\\u00e9e G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale de l\\u2019ONU devraient s\\u2019appliquer. \\u25aa Il est primordial lors de l\\u2019\\u00e9tablissement des programmes de travail du Comit\\u00e9 intergouvernemental, de pr\\u00e9voir un examen au pr\\u00e9alable du syst\\u00e8me fiscal international actuel afin d\\u2019\\u00e9valuer l\\u2019efficacit\\u00e9 et l\\u2019inclusivit\\u00e9 des instruments juridiques internationaux existant et d\\u00e9celer les failles \\u00e0 combler. 2- Dispositions op\\u00e9rationnelles : \\u25aa Afin de permettre \\u00e0 tous les Etats de faire entendre leur voix et indiquer leurs priorit\\u00e9s lors de l\\u2019\\u00e9tablissement du programme de travail du Comit\\u00e9 intergouvernemental, il est sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que les propositions des Etats soient discut\\u00e9es et coordonn\\u00e9es au sein des groupes r\\u00e9gionaux puis transmises au Secr\\u00e9tariat par l\\u2019interm\\u00e9diaire des repr\\u00e9sentants desdits groupes. \\u25aa Les pays en d\\u00e9veloppement devraient participer au dialogue de fa\\u00e7on \\u00e9quitable, d\\u2019o\\u00f9 l\\u2019importance de b\\u00e9n\\u00e9ficier de programmes d\\u2019assistance technique dans le but de renforcer leurs capacit\\u00e9s fiscales afin de se mettre \\u00e0 niveau avec les pays d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9s. \\u25aa L\\u2019ONU joue un r\\u00f4le important dans l\\u2019\\u00e9laboration des normes fiscale internationale par l\\u2019interm\\u00e9diaire du Comit\\u00e9 des Experts de la coop\\u00e9ration internatio nale en mati\\u00e8re fiscale.

A cet effet, l a Convention -cadre devrait pr\\u00e9ciser le r\\u00f4le du Comit\\u00e9 des Experts sur la coop\\u00e9ration internationale ainsi que ses sous -comit\\u00e9s.

Ces textes devraient \\u00eatre adopt\\u00e9s par le Comit\\u00e9 afin de leur donner le caract\\u00e8re gouvernemental et procurer aux nouveaux organes de l\\u2019ONU l\\u2019autorit\\u00e9 pour les mettre \\u00e0 jour. \\u25aa En ce qui concerne les r\\u00e8gles fiscales internationales qui feront l\\u2019objet de la Convention - cadre et des pro tocoles et en tant que pays en d\\u00e9veloppement, il est primordial que l esdites r\\u00e8gles soient harmonis\\u00e9es, simples et faciles \\u00e0 comprendre et \\u00e0 appliquer. \\u25aa La mise en place d\\u2019un m\\u00e9canisme de suivi de l\\u2019application des dispositions de la Convention -cadre et des protocoles tel qu\\u2019un examen par les pairs, afin de s\\u2019assurer de l\\u2019application conforme et appropri\\u00e9 par tous les Etats Membres. \\u25aa Le d\\u00e9lai accord\\u00e9 aux Etats membres, pour examiner une disposition et soumettre une position, devrait \\u00eatre raisonnable afin de pouvoir donner plus de possibilit\\u00e9 \\u00e0 l\\u2019\\u00e9tude de l\\u2019impact de chaque mesure et les consultations \\u00e9ventuelles avec les parties prenantes. 3- Cadre temporel : \\u25aa Il est primordial de pr\\u00e9ciser dans les termes de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences de la Convention -cadre , la dur\\u00e9e du mandat du Comit\\u00e9 ainsi q ue celle du bureau dudit Comit\\u00e9 et mentionner le d\\u00e9lai imparti pour la finalisation de ladite Convention -cadre . \\u25aa Il est n\\u00e9c essaire \\u00e9galement de d\\u00e9terminer la fr\\u00e9quence des r\\u00e9unions de travail du Comit\\u00e9, en l\\u2019occurrence s\\u2019inspirer du c alendrier des sessions du Comit\\u00e9 des Experts sur la coop\\u00e9ration internationale en mati\\u00e8re fiscale, \\u00e0 savoir deux r\\u00e9unions par an, en mars et en octobre. \\u25aa Les termes de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences devraient mentionner la structure des organes issus du Comit\\u00e9 intergouvernemental qui seraient charg\\u00e9 durant la dur\\u00e9e du mandat, de l\\u2019\\u00e9laboration de la Convention -cadre . A cet \\u00e9gard , il serait opportun de proposer la cr\\u00e9ation de sous -Comit\\u00e9s ou de groupes ad hoc sp\\u00e9cifiques \\u00e0 chaque domaine, \\u00e0 l\\u2019instar de l\\u2019organisation du Comit\\u00e9 des Experts. 4- Domaines prioritaires sp\\u00e9cifiques possibles qui devraient faire l'objet de protocoles simultan\\u00e9s : \\u25aa S\\u2019agissant de la s uggestion de n\\u00e9gocier des protocoles relatifs \\u00e0 des th\\u00e9matiques prioritaires en m\\u00eame temps que la Convention -cadre , le Maroc consid\\u00e8re que lesdits protocole s sont tr\\u00e8s techniques et devraient \\u00eatre \\u00e9labor\\u00e9s par des experts pour chaque domaine et non par le comit\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9daction de la Convention -cadre . \\u25aa La Convention -cadre devrait inclure une liste des th\\u00e9matiques qui feraient l\\u2019objet de protocoles prioritaires dont notamment : \\u27a2 la lutte contre les flux financiers illicites ; \\u27a2 l\\u2019impositio n des services transfrontaliers ; \\u27a2 les questions relatives aux incitations fiscales ; \\u27a2 la transparence fiscale ; \\u27a2 les probl\\u00e9matiques inh\\u00e9rentes aux \\u00e9volutions technologiques, notamment celles des cryptoactifs , de la blockchain et de l\\u2019intelligence artificielle et l\\u2019analyse de leur impact sur les administrations fiscales. 5- Ressources pour sout enir les travaux au sein du Comit\\u00e9 : Il serait opportun d\\u2019accorder une assistance financi\\u00e8re au profit des pays en d\\u00e9veloppement pour assurer leur participation en pr\\u00e9sentiel aux r\\u00e9unions du Comit\\u00e9 .\",\n          \"Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia . 14 de marzo de 2024 Sr. Ramy Youseff Presidente del Comit\\u00e9 Ad Hoc para la redacci\\u00f3n de los T\\u00e9rminos de Referencia para una Convenci\\u00f3n Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre Cooperaci\\u00f3n Fiscal Internacional Asunto: Aportes para el trabajo del Comit\\u00e9 de la Convenci\\u00f3n Fiscal de las Naciones Unidas 1. Consideraciones general es La plena realizaci\\u00f3n de los derechos humanos exige la existencia de instituciones s\\u00f3lidas que administren, asignen y utilicen los recursos p\\u00fablicos de manera transparente, participativa y responsable. Este principio se fundamenta en el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Econ\\u00f3micos, Sociales y Culturales (PIDESC)1, que reconoce la importancia de maximizar la movilizaci\\u00f3n de recursos disponibles como un paso crucial hacia la realizaci\\u00f3n progresiva de los derechos humanos. En el marco de la convocatoria abierta de aportaciones para la primera sesi\\u00f3n sustantiva del Comit\\u00e9 Ad Hoc para la Elaboraci\\u00f3n de T\\u00e9rminos de Referencia (ToR s) para un Convenio Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre Cooperaci\\u00f3n Fiscal Internacional (en adelante, el Convenio Marco), desde el Centro de Est udios de Derecho, Justicia y Sociedad (Dej usticia)2, creemos que el objetivo primordial es buscar la movilizaci\\u00f3n \\u00f3ptima de los recursos de los Estados para fortalecer sus ingresos mediante una recaudaci\\u00f3n tributaria eficiente que permita avanzar hacia la plena realizaci\\u00f3n de los derechos humanos. 1 United Nations (1966). International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments -mechanisms/instruments/international -covenant - economic -social -and-cultural -rights 2 Ver: https://www.dejusticia.org/ En este contexto, promover la cooperaci\\u00f3n fiscal internacional implica garantizar equidad , transparencia y progresividad de los sistemas tributarios , as\\u00ed como combatir los flujos financieros il\\u00edcitos relacionados con los impuestos. Al alcanzar estos objetivos, no solo se contribuye a reducir la desigualdad dentro y entre los pa\\u00edses, sino que tambi\\u00e9n se facilita la movilizaci\\u00f3n de financiamiento necesa rio para que los gobiernos cumplan con sus compromisos internacionales. Esto incluye no solo los relacionados con los derechos humanos, sino tambi\\u00e9n aquellos vinculados a la protecci\\u00f3n ambiental, la igualdad y el logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible. 2. Elementos estructurales de la convenci\\u00f3n marco Existen numerosos temas relevantes que podr\\u00edan ser incluidos en una Convenci\\u00f3n Marco, como la distribuci\\u00f3n de las competencias tributarias entre jurisdicciones, las responsabilidades en relaci\\u00f3n con el intercambio de informaci\\u00f3n, los intereses de los pa\\u00edses de ingresos bajos y medios respecto al financiamiento del cambio clim\\u00e1tico y la persecuci\\u00f3n de la evasi\\u00f3n y elusi\\u00f3n fiscal . Sin embargo, todos estos aspectos convergen en un desaf\\u00edo transversal: la lucha contra los flujos financieros il\\u00edcitos para contar con los recursos que permitan hacer frente a las necesidades de los Estados como las relacionadas con el cambio clim\\u00e1tico . En muchos pa\\u00edses del sur global, la evidencia ha revelado que la falta de capacidad para reducir los flujos il\\u00edcitos obstaculiza la movilizaci\\u00f3n de los recursos disponibles. Y en varias instancias, esta situaci\\u00f3n no requiere adquirir recursos adicionales, sino aprovechar de manera m\\u00e1s eficiente las capacidades existentes de los Estados3. 2.1. Elementos sustantivos : (i) Obligaciones extraterritoriales de los Estados: Esta es una cuesti\\u00f3n que se ha ido consolidando como uno de los desarrollos jurisprudenciales por parte de las instancias internacionales de derechos humanos, en especial por los \\u00f3rganos de tratados de 3 Abugre, C., Cobham, A., Etter -Phoya, R., L\\u00e9pissier, A., Meinzer, M., Monkam, N., & Mosioma, A. (2019). Vulnerability and Exposure to Illicit Financial Flows risk in Africa. Tax Justice Network, August , 20. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3440066 Naciones Unidas, como el Comit\\u00e9 de Derechos Econ\\u00f3micos, Sociales y Culturales (DESC)4. La idea esencial es que los Estados, conforme a los art\\u00edculos 55 y 56 de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, deben contribuir al logro de los prop\\u00f3sitos de las Naciones Unidas, uno de los cuales es la vigencia en el mundo de los derechos humanos. Por consigu ientes los Estados tienen la responsabilidad no solo de respetar y contribuir a la garant\\u00eda de los derechos humanos en su territorio, sino tambi\\u00e9n fuera de \\u00e9l. Adicionalmente, el PIDESC establece que, para lograr progresivamente el pleno goce de los derechos sociales, los Estados se comprometen a la adopci\\u00f3n de medidas \\u201ctanto a nivel individual como mediante la asistencia y la cooperaci\\u00f3n internacionales, especialmente econ\\u00f3micas y t\\u00e9cnicas, hasta el m \\u00e1ximo de los recursos de que disponga\\u201d5. Esto significa no s\\u00f3lo que cada Estado puede recurrir a esa cooperaci\\u00f3n internacional, cuando sus recursos sean insuficientes, sino que, dentro de ciertos l\\u00edmites, los otros Estados m\\u00e1s poderosos tienen un cierto deber de cooperaci\\u00f3n para que los Estados menos desarrollados puedan lograr la plena realizaci\\u00f3n de los derechos de su poblaci\\u00f3n . En consecuencia, los Estados deben colaborar activamente con otros pa\\u00edses y organizaciones para fortalecer la integridad del sistema financiero internacional. Una medida fundamental es establecer obligaciones de intercambio de informaci\\u00f3n sobre las personas y empresas que operan dentro de sus jurisdicciones, como la que reposa en el registro de beneficiarios finales. Tambi\\u00e9n se deben establecer rendiciones de cuentas sobre tratados y acuerdos fiscales, gastos fiscales y tasas nominales y efectivas de tributaci\\u00f3n6 especialmente de las multinacionales. 4 General comment No. 24 (2017) on State obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the context of business activities.

Varias instancias internacionales de derechos humanos de la ONU, como el Comit\\u00e9 de DESC , as\\u00ed como el Comit\\u00e9 de Derechos del Ni\\u00f1o, han conclui do que la competencia a la baja tributaria constituye una violaci\\u00f3n de las obligaciones extraterritoriales de los Estados en materia de derechos humanos8. La forma m\\u00e1s extrema y perniciosa de estas estrategias de competencia a la baja tributaria se manifiesta en los llamados para\\u00edsos fiscales. Estos son lugares que no solo imponen tasas impositivas m\\u00ednimas, casi inexistentes, sino que tambi\\u00e9n promueven el secreto bancario y muestran reluctancia para cooperar con otros pa\\u00edses en la lucha contra la evasi\\u00f3n y la elusi\\u00f3n fiscal. Esto, a su vez, facilita el lavado de ganancias derivadas de actividades criminales, exacerbando as\\u00ed los desaf\\u00edos asociados con la jus ticia fiscal a nivel global9. En este contexto, los ToRs deben considerar como la lucha contra los para\\u00edsos fiscales y la competencia a la baja tributaria como aspectos sustantivos . Esto podr\\u00eda lograrse mediante la implementaci\\u00f3n de una tarifa m\\u00ednima corporativa global sobre las ganancias, que todas las multinacionales est\\u00e9n obligadas a pagar en los lugares donde operan. Dicha tarifa deber\\u00eda ser equitativa y justa, de manera que no solo beneficie a los pa\\u00edses m\\u00e1s ricos, sino que tambi\\u00e9n promueva la equidad fiscal a nivel mundial. (iii) Progresividad tributaria para combatir el cambio clim\\u00e1tico: Seg\\u00fan un estudio del World Inequality Lab10, el 10% m\\u00e1s rico del mundo es responsable de la mitad de las emisiones de carbono planetarias, 7 Union Commission/United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (2015).

Climate inequality report 2023, fair taxes for a sustainable future in the global south. https://wid.world/news -article/climate -inequality -report -2023-fair-taxes -for-a- sustainable -future -in-the-global -south/ mientras que la mitad m\\u00e1s pobre de la poblaci\\u00f3n apenas contribuye con el 12 % del total global, lo que equivale a una media de 1,6 toneladas de carbono por persona. Estos hallazgos resaltan una marcada desigualdad en las contribuciones al problema clim\\u00e1tic o. Y en respuesta a esto, Chancel propone la implementaci\\u00f3n de impuestos ecol\\u00f3gicos progresivos basados en la riqueza. En respuesta a la urgencia clim\\u00e1tica, ser\\u00e1 necesario que dentro de los ToRs se plantee como objetivo implementar medidas de impuestos globales progresivos que aborden el problema del cambio clim\\u00e1tico que afecta todos los pa\\u00edses. Al establecer este tipo de medidas , se podr\\u00eda garantizar que aquellos que m\\u00e1s contribuyen a la crisis clim\\u00e1tica asuman una carga proporcionalmente mayor, mientras se protege a los sectores m\\u00e1s vulnerables de los Estados. Este enfoque no solo promover\\u00eda la equidad econ\\u00f3mica y luchar\\u00eda contra la pobreza11, sino que tambi\\u00e9n ofrece r\\u00eda incentivos para la innovaci\\u00f3n tecnol\\u00f3gica y la adopci\\u00f3n de pol\\u00edticas ambientales responsables a nivel global. 2.2. Elementos procedimentales (i) Foro intergubernamental equitativo : \\u201cLos Gobiernos deben crear mecanismos de gobernanza nacional s\\u00f3lidos y coordinados que refuercen de manera eficiente la integridad financiera para el desarrollo sostenible, adem\\u00e1s de publicar evaluaciones nacionales de su propio desempe\\u00f1o \\u201d12. Por esto, es importante el establecimiento de un foro intergubernamental globalmente inclusivo que pueda reunir las diversos estados del sistema global, para crear normas equitativas en materia tributaria y solucionar los problemas de coordinaci\\u00f3n y sobrecarga13. Actualmente, el proceso de elaboraci\\u00f3n de normas y est\\u00e1ndares fiscales internacionales est\\u00e1 mayormente liderado por la OCDE y el G20, quienes han desarrollado dos marcos importantes para abordar la cooperaci\\u00f3n 11 De Schutter, O., Lusiani, N.

Sin embargo, la participaci\\u00f3n de los pa\\u00edses en la negociaci\\u00f3n y elaboraci\\u00f3n de estos marcos est\\u00e1 condicionada a la implementaci\\u00f3n de los est\\u00e1ndares y normas subyacentes, lo que ha excluido a los pa\\u00edses en desarrollo . (ii) Mecanismo para t ransparencia de la informaci\\u00f3n: La implementaci\\u00f3n de un mecanismo estandarizado que asegure el acceso equitativo a la informaci\\u00f3n de manera desagregada y completa14 para todas las partes signatarias de la Convenci\\u00f3n es crucial para fomentar la transparencia y la cooperaci\\u00f3n internacional en materia tributaria. Este enfoque busca eliminar la dependencia de acuerdos bilaterales y garantizar que todos los pa\\u00edses, sin importar su p oder econ\\u00f3mico, tengan igualdad de condiciones en el intercambio de informaci\\u00f3n. Este mecanismo estandarizado, no solo promover\\u00e1 la exposici\\u00f3n de los acuerdos fiscales de todas las naciones, sino que tambi\\u00e9n facilitar\\u00e1 las negociaciones multilaterales y ayudar\\u00e1 a prevenir la evasi\\u00f3n fiscal y los flujos il\\u00edcitos , a traves del acceso a informaci\\u00f3n que reposa en registros como el de beneficiarios finales . Esto permitir\\u00eda conocer los verdaderos propietarios de organizaciones y sus tributos efectivos y facilitar\\u00eda a las autoridades el rastreo y la mitigaci\\u00f3n de actividades financieras il\\u00edcitas, fomentando as\\u00ed pr\\u00e1cticas empresariales \\u00e9ticas y responsables. (iii) Un mecanismo id\\u00f3neo de soluci\\u00f3n de disputas : Ser\\u00e1 necesario un mecanismo de resoluci\\u00f3n de disputas a trav\\u00e9s de canales diplom\\u00e1ticos y con autoridades competentes15, que garantice el trato igualitario, la participaci\\u00f3n equitativa de todos los Estados parte y que tome en cuenta las obligaciones de los Estados en materia de derechos humanos . Esto permitir \\u00eda garantizar una interpretaci\\u00f3n y aplicaci\\u00f3n uniforme de las disposiciones acordadas en el Convenio Marco, 14Initiative for human rights in fiscal policy (2021) Principles for Human Rights in Fiscal Policy.

SUBJECTIVE ELEMENTSSUBSTANCIAL ELEMENTSPROCEDURAL ELEMENTS 2 A new international tax cooperation principle is created by 1. The respect for the democratic socio -economic principles and the fundamental Human Rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the United Nations Charter and in International legal/tax order, inspire the present tax convention. It is supported on the principles of tax justice, legal security, equity, efficiency, transparency, neutrality, certainty and simplicity, effectiveness, fairness and flexibility (Ott awa Ministerial conference) . 2. A new \\u201cPrinciple of International Tax Cooperation\\u201d is set by the UN tax convention. 1. Achieve international tax co -operation in solving problems of economic, social, technologic, environmental, educational, and humanitarian character. 2. Set the framework bases of a new global tax governance architecture design, strengthening \\\"fairness & efficient\\\" regional, national, and international financial and tax policies in the face of the changing global landscape, committed to combati ng any kind of tax avoidance/evasion and criminal tax, as well as improving tax compliance systems and tax risk management processes of tax administrations. 3. Mobilization of domestic resources and investments to provide the basic needs and services for deve loping countries still underfunded. The UN tax convention objective is to strengthen international fiscal cooperation and good global fiscal governance, through the articulation of economic, fiscal, social and ethical measures, contributing to the i mprovement of fiscal systems and economies as well as to protect the rights of taxpayers, intermediaries and stakeholders. The UN tax convention should preserve the commitments assumed by the States derived from the bilateral or multilateral instruments that the parties have taken in these subjects, and the hard law and soft law sources of the international tax/fiscal , international economic law, commercial law, customs law etc Contributing to achievement of the sixteen sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the U N 2030 Agenda and the future ones targets (twi 2050; EU 2050; 2063 African Union Agenda, etc.), as well as to the achievement of th e Addis Ababa Action Agenda objectives; the Doha Declaration; the Monterrey consensus , \\u2026 Collect of domestic financial resources to support the efforts for the achievement of the SDG (GOALS 1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 17\\u2026) , Redistribution of wealth for public wellbeing and to raise more revenue in an equitable way , \\u2026 Go on the new multilateralism consensus, promoting the effective participation of ministers and finance vice -ministers, tax authorities and representatives of academia, civil society, private sector, SMEs, MNEs, regional and global international organizations, institutional tax associations, and the rest of the stakeholders . The UN Tax convention should follow the last generation international economic cooperation treaties, with a holistic view, in line with the new generation of trade agreements (FTAs), dealing not only with economic aspects, but also cultural, social, ethical, and environmental ones , including aspects such as: administrative cooperation, mutual assistance, customs, taxation of the digital economy, transfer pricing, taxpayers rights (domestic and cross -border), ADR systems for cross - border tax conflicts, tax compliance, simplify systems, accounting systems, etc. The UN Tax Convention should follow the consensus standards established for the United Nations . In the United Nations the general rules of consensus are: UNIMITY and 2/3 MAJORITY. \\uf075 INTERNATIONAL TAX COOPERATION ON TAX ADMINISTRATION 3.0, digitization of tax administrations, robotics and cybersecurity, risk management processes \\uf075 DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS.

Such a convention would facilitate international cooperation in combatting tax avoidance and evasion, ensuring that multinational corporations and wealthy individuals contribute their fair share. This collective effort would significantly bolster governments' capacity to finance essential public services and development projects. Furthermore, the implementation of a fair global taxation framework could mitigate disparities between tax systems, discouraging harmful practices like the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates and creating a more equitable playing field for all nations. For ORG, which advocates for engagement, transparency, and accountability, this shift towards global fiscal responsibility is in alignment with its mission to advance good governance and has the potential to greatly enhance economic and social development efforts in The Bahamas and beyond. In The Bahamas, tax reform is not merely a fiscal imperative but a crucial stride towards achieving economic stability, transparency, and equitable growth. The effectiveness of any tax policy hinges on the adoption of a culture of fiscal accountability by governments, political entities, and citizens alike. Therefore, this recommendation underscores the necessity for comprehensive fiscal reform alongside tax reform, guided by principles of accountability, compliance, efficient business structure, constructive relationships with tax authorities, prudent acceptance of tax incentives, support for effective tax systems, and transparency. This following recommendations are offered to address the urgent need for a holistic approach to taxation reform in The Bahamas. Drawing on international best practices and adhering to the Responsible Tax Principles, this document aims to guide the development of a white paper for consideration in a United Nations Convention on Taxation. Structural and Procedural Recommendations for a UN Convention on Taxation: 1. Encouragement of Fiscal Responsibility and Reform: Iinclusion of measures within the convention that promote fiscal responsibility and reform in addition to taxation reforms. This could involve the establishment of mechanisms to monitor and enforce fiscal targets, as well as the development of incentives for governments to adopt prudent fiscal policies. Encouraging fiscal responsibility and reform alongside taxation reform will further contribute to economic stability, transparency, and equitable growth in The Bahamas and other Small Island Developing States (SIDS). By fostering a culture of fiscal accountability, governments can better manage their finances and ensure the effective allocation of resources towards essential public services and development projects, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of taxation policies and promoting sustainable economic and social growth 2.Equitable Treatment of Small Island Developing States (SIDS): Advocate for the inclusion of provisions within the convention that recognize the unique vulnerabilities of SIDS like The Bahamas to climate change and disasters. Ensure that global taxation regimes take into account the specific challenges faced by SIDS and do not unfairly penalize their offshore financial markets. 3. Transparency and Consistency in Taxation Standards: Call for transparency and consistency in the application of global tax standards and regulations, particularly regarding oversight and sanctions imposed by external regulators from western developed nations. Ensure that the particular context of countries like The Bahamas is considered in all taxation-related decisions. 4. Protection of Local Advantages and Economic Opportunity: Advocate for provisions within the convention that protect the local advantages of countries like The Bahamas and promote economic opportunity and growth. Ensure that global tax schemes do not unduly harm the local private sector or inhibit the country's capacity to attract competitive foreign direct investment. 5. Promotion of Low Tax Jurisdictions with Accountability: Support the transition of countries like The Bahamas to become low tax jurisdictions, provided that this transition is conducted in a manner that maintains equity, transparency, and accountability in governance. Ensure that tax incentives and exemptions are provided responsibly and do not lead to tax evasion or other forms of financial misconduct. 6. Incentives for Community-Level Development through Civil Society: Advocate for provisions within the convention that promote the role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in community-level development. Support the provision of incentives for investment in CSOs to empower them to contribute effectively to sustainable economic and social growth across the archipelago of The Bahamas. 7. Stakeholder Engagement and Participation: Emphasize the importance of meaningful engagement and participation of all stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and international organizations, in the development and implementation of global taxation regimes. Ensure that the voices and perspectives of all relevant parties are considered in decision-making processes. 8. Capacity Building and Technical Assistance: Support capacity building initiatives and provide technical assistance to countries like The Bahamas to enhance their ability to comply with global taxation standards and regulations. This may involve training programs, knowledge-sharing platforms, and other forms of support to strengthen tax administration and enforcement capabilities. 9. Adherence to Principles of Good Governance: Ensure that the convention upholds principles of equity, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness in governance throughout its implementation. Promote fairness and effectiveness in taxation policies to contribute to more inclusive and sustainable economic and social growth across The Bahamas and other SIDS. Conclusion In conclusion, the recommendations outlined above represent a holistic approach to taxation reform from the perspective of the Organization for Responsible Governance (ORG). By advocating for equitable treatment of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), transparency in taxation standards, and protection of local advantages, these recommendations aim to address the urgent need for comprehensive fiscal reform in The Bahamas. Through stakeholder engagement, capacity building, and adherence to principles of good governance, the proposed structural and procedural measures seek to ensure that any UN Convention on taxation promotes more inclusive and sustainable economic and social growth not only in The Bahamas but also across SIDS worldwide. By aligning taxation policies with principles of accountability, transparency, and equity, this framework has the potential to foster international cooperation, reduce tax evasion, and create a more level playing field for all countries. Ultimately, by implementing these recommendations, we can work towards a future where taxation supports, rather than hinders, the development and prosperity of nations like The Bahamas.\",\n          \"Submission by the Digital Cooperation Organization1 to the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee for Drafting Terms of Reference for a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation First Substantive Session \\u2013 1 5 March 2024 1 This work is prepared by Dr. Najeeb Memon, Digital Taxation Director at the DCO General Secretariat . He can be accessed at nmemon@dco.org . The opinions expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Digital Cooperation Organization\\u2019s Member States , either individually or jointly. 2/6 INTRODUCTION The Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) welcomes the opportunity to submit input for the First Substantive Session of the Ad Hoc Committee for drafting Terms of Reference (ToR) for the United Nations Framework Convention (FC) on International Tax Cooperation. While DCO is fully convinced that international tax cooperation should be secured through the platform of the United Nations for it to be transparent, inclusive , and effective, it suggests addressing t he fundamental question of allocation of taxing rights in the digitalized world in a simple way to ensure fairness and efficiency of the international tax system . SUBMISSION S The submission by the DCO will cover two topics. The first one related to ToR on the procedural component of the structural framework of the F C on International Tax Cooperation. The second one is related to the substantive component of the F C. 1. Procedural Component of the Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation Following are submissions regarding the procedural component. 1.1. Definitions, Objectives, and Principles should be aligned with the indicative list of elements of the substantive part of the FC. 1.2. A fully -fledged secretariat is necessary for the FC. 1.3. Conference of Parties (C oP) of sovereign states should be created as a supreme decision - making body. 1.4. CoP should have the power to adopt protocols and amendments in the F C. 1.5. Each party to CoP must have a right to vote. However, the number of votes necessary for each decision may vary depending on the nature of the protocol or the amendment. 1.6. There should be at least two subsidiary bodies \\u2013 one for doing necessary research on issues to assist CoP, and another subsidiary body for monitoring implementation. 1.7. There should be a commitment to meet the education and training needs of tax administrations on international taxation and ICT , especially for developing countries. 1.8. There should be a commitment to access and exchange of financial statements of MNEs. 3/6 1.9. There should be a commitment to help SMEs in developing countries adopt ICT for combating large informal sectors. 1.10. A robust and trustworthy dispute resolution mechanism should be included in the FC. 1.11. There should be a financial mechanism for meeting the FC's work costs . 2. Substantive Component of Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation The following are submissions regarding the indicative list of matters that could be addressed in the draft ToR for the substantive component of the F C. These matters should be highlighted in the F C as a protocol priority . These submissions , in addition to many others, suggest two Principles of the F C \\u2013 First, equitable allocation of taxing rights, and second , protection of state sovereignty on tax matters. 2.1. Allocation of Taxing Rights on Simple, Equitable , and Efficient Basis Taxing rights have traditionally been entitled in favor of developed countries because of their position as capital and technology exporters . The OECD Model Convention for Taxes on Income and on Capital as an instrument of the Bilateral Tax Convention (BTC) is visibly imbalanced. The developed countries achieve their national goal of securing the most taxing rights due to their competitive advantages of capital and technology . On the other hand , developing countries historically offer tax concessions to access capital and technology and forego their right ful taxing rights in this tax competition resulting in cross -border erosion of their tax bases .2 Thus, a fair international tax equilibrium is needed. The existing international rules for allocat ing taxing rights are based on the Principle of Origin which derives strength from the Benefits Theory , Ability to Pay Theory , etc.3 Undoubtedly, market jurisdictions of developing countries provide benefits of access to markets and infrastructure to consume goods and therefore have some right to tax . Under the latest Value Creation Theory , economic value is created either where the goods or services are created and where these are sold and consumed .4 2 Garfias von Furstenberg , G. (2021) \\u2018Allocation of Taxing Rights in Tax Treaties between Developing and Developed Countries : Re-thinking Principles \\u2019 Doctoral Thesis, Maastricht University , Netherlands. 3 Ivan Ozai (2021), \\u2018Origin and Differentiation in International Income Allocation\\u2019 44:1 Dalhousie Law Journal , p- 133. 4 Ibid. 4/6 The Value Creation Theory is consistent with the accounting principle of recognition of revenue whereby income is credited in the income statement when goods or services are sold or use d. These theories hold ground even for digital goods and services. Unfortunately, most BTCs between developed and developing countries do not conform to these age - old theories. For example, t he condition s of physical presence in the form of PE to tax business; and denial of taxing rights at origin for royalty income are the concessions given by developing countries to access technology . Further , MNEs now substitute physical PEs with virtual P Es (De -facto) to sell their products through e - commerce in developing countries for their poor infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. It is evident in increasing the volume of international trade as sales by PEs are being substituted by exports by MNEs. It is untenable to hold that income does not arise in market jurisdictions merely due to the shifting of trading mechanisms to electronic modes or the increasing volume of digital goods and services. Such an interpretation of facts would deprive the developing countri es of their share of taxing rights. The issue applies squarely to cross -border business services . Thus, the FC should mention fair allocation of taxing rights as a priority in its protocols. 2.2. State Sovereignty be Protected Regarding Taxation and Tax Concessions BTC negotiations demonstrate the inherent tax competition involved in this process as each participating state aims to achieve its national goal by using its competitive advantages. Resultantly, developed countries mostly win taxing rights while developing countries get access to capital and technology by not taxing income in their jurisdictions. Besides that, p oor infrastructure and weak regulatory framework have additional influence on developing countries to offer tax concessions to attract capital and t echnology to harness the full potential of their economic factors like natural and human resources . In this competition involving competitive advantages and economic factors of engaging parties, there should not be any discriminatory restraints on any party. Rationally, d eveloping countries should not be restrained from granting tax concessions to attract capital and R&D while developed countries should not be restrained from using their tech superiority to secure all taxing rights. In the given scenario, let all countries compete with their strengths within reasonable limits. Unilateral action against developing countries would leave them as mere consumer markets for developed countries , further worsening income inequality between the two and jeopardizing the world order. 5/6 A study proposes that free tax competition is essential for the efficient allocation of resources , reduction of global poverty , and equal distribution of wealth.5 All states are equal sovereigns under the UN charter and taxation is an inherent component of sovereign status6. The dissolution of sovereignty exclusively for taxation cannot be approved on the pretext of ending tax competition because tax competition is driven by several competitive advantages that states possess . If sovereignty is to be dissolved it should be dissolved for all these competitive advantages. Likewise, the OECD\\u2019s demand for a centralized tax system for achieving equity in the tax system is untenable as equity in tax is relevant to the domestic realm ,7 and redistributive justice at the international level requires rationalization of other factors influencing capital allocations , and expenditure programs at the global level. If the global public interest is the central goal, then all laws and resources should be aligned with this goal. More aptly, a global community cannot be created selectively for taxation without other factors of welfare such as the sharing of technology, free flow of human resources , and distribution of wealth amassed in the hands of a few. Therefore, the FC should provide a commitment to the protection of the state sovereignty in taxation. 2.3. Allocation of Taxing Rights of Intellectual Properties (IPs) and their Scoping First, c onsistent with Para 2.1. taxing rights be allocated based on economic value created in a jurisdiction. All classes of income be treated the same8 even for allocating taxing rights. When income from immovable property is taxed in the source jurisdiction as the economic value is generated there , then, rationally royalties\\u2019 income on the use of Intellectual Properties (IPs) be taxed in the jurisdiction where those are used . 5 David Elkins, (2016), \\u2018The Merits of Tax Competition in a Globalized Economy\\u2019 91:3 Indiana Law Journal , Maurer School of Law: Indiana University, p -905 6 Allison Christians, (200() \\u2018Sovereignty, Taxation and Social Contract \\u2019 1 8:1 Minnesota Journal of International Law, University of Minnesota Law School , P-104. 7 Elkins (2016) Above n, 5, p-942 8 Jason Furman, (2008), \\u2018The Concept of Neutrality in Tax Policy\\u2019 The Brookings Institution, Testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance Hearing on \\u2018Tax: Fundamental in Advance of Reforms\\u2019 , USA ; Lena Hiort af Ornas Leijon, (201 5) \\u2018 Tax Policy, Economic Efficiency and the Principle of Neutrality from the Legal and Economic Perspective \\u2019 Working Paper 201 5 -2, Faculty of Law, Uppsala University, Sweden, P -23. 6/6 The intangible nature of IPs and the ease with which they can be transferred cannot refute the fact that they are used in market jurisdictions , which have contributed to the economic value and consequently are entitled to some taxing rights. Though developing countries need IP-related technology and hence continue accepting unfair allocation of taxing rights, that would deprive them of essential revenues for sustainable development resulting in massive income disparities between developing and developed countries which might tear apart the global fabric. Second, t he overlaps between royalties, fees for technical services, and Automated Digital Services (ADS) should be resolved through scoping of IPs . It should be understood that the automation of processes and tasks through ICT -based mediums such as software and AI are not analogous to the use of processes or copyrighted and patented item s because buyer s do not use them. Instead , these tasks are automatically performed with simple prompts. Therefore , automati on of tasks of all kinds through ICT-related interventions should be treated as services as distinct from letting out of other IPs for use by the licensee. More broadly, the distinctions between ADS , software , and other IPs need to be defined in a simple flexible manner to avoid ambiguities like one in Article 1 2B (7) in the UN Model Tax Convention , which envisages that the items already covered as royalties and fee for technical service will be excluded f rom ADS . Para 62 of the UN Commentary on its Model Tax Convent ion regarding Article 12B stresses some challenges here. Therefore, the FC should give priority to the fair allocation of taxing rights of IPs in its protocols. 2.4. Tax -related Illicit Financial Flows from Aggressive Tax Planning and Tax Evasion The tax -related illicit financial flows are driven by tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. The latter is mostly addressed by the OECD BEPS project , and by the UN through the latest amendments of its model BTC. The former is related to developing countries for their large informal economies. Alongside other measures, international tax cooperation is needed in building the capacity of SMEs, which dominate informal sectors, and of tax administrations for adopting ICT technology to simplify bookkeeping, facilitate tax compliance, and strengthen tax enforcement to mobilize untapped revenue potential of informal sectors and raise tax to GDP ratio. The FC should provide a commitment for this capacity building of SMEs .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 101,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': 0.9998}\",\n          \"{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9995}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"language\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ru\",\n          \"ro\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3632612468964145,\n        \"min\": -0.9332,\n        \"max\": 0.9999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          0.9962\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pos\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.05144689941781995,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.237,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 67,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.151,\n          0.202\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"neg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.018580331198851163,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.094,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 48,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.069,\n          0.033\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"neu\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.21746241545072217,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.811,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vote\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"N\",\n          \"A\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The UAE supports the UN in its goal to achieve inclusive international tax cooperation and reiterates the need for consensus -based decision making and outcomes to ensure effective cooperation is achieved and long -term implementation of all outcomes is possible by all member states. The UAE encourages the UN to focus on gaps in effective international tax reforms to ensure tax policy makers and administrators efforts are appropriately targeted and to avoid any potential duplication of efforts with other ongoing international tax refor ms. We reiterate the need for the Committee to focus on realistic goals and timeframes and i tems of substantive matters . In particular, we highlight the need for the Committee to focus on: o Strengthening capacity building Initiatives to ensure developing countries and least -developed countries can effectively implement both current and future international tax reforms. o Minimizing the additional burden on Tax Administrations and Businesses of all international tax reforms. This is important to ensure that the compliance burden for all stakeholders remains as low as possible whilst not hindering the integrity of the policy objectives. o Applying efforts in the area of simplification and dispute resolution, for example by way of the application of safe harbors or transitional relief s to complement the above two objectives and give all stakeholders sufficient time to fully comply with the rules. As a partnering jurisdiction with Singapore on the Committee Bureau , we echo Singapore\\u2019s comments on the TOR document and we reiterate their call for the Committee to make use of other organizations (e.g. OECD) / existing platforms (e.g. the Platform for Collaboration on Tax) to provide technical expertise to support the AHC\\u2019s work . In addition, t o ensure that all inputs are considered, and needs addressed, we also request that there is sufficient time for negotiating the Convention so that the Committee can arrive at practical and well thought through long term solutions that can best serve the collective interests of all member states to ensure coordinated policy objectives are met. Conclusion As a country that has recently transitioned from a 2.2. No/Nominal tax jurisdiction status to a 2.1 jurisdiction and is in the process of undertaking significant domestic and international corporate tax reforms, we reiterate our commitment in sharing knowledge on such important matters and playing a constructive role by bridging differences and building common ground between member states that maybe implementing their own domestic reforms . In addition, a s a partnering bureau member, w e will continue to participate actively in the technical and procedural discussions, and we look forward to collaborating and collectively working towards a draft TOR for the Framework Convention that all member states can support.

First of all, I would like to assure you that Latvia fully supports internat ional cooperation to address global challenges, therefore we support the objectives of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation. We believe that the United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation could serve to promote an equitable and sustainable approach to international tax cooperation at the global level. We consider that coherence with ongoing work and consensus achieved in the OECD and other international fora is very important, aiming to engage in effective coopera tion to ensure a consistent approach to global tax challenges. Therefore, the United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation should seek to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary extra budget claims. We also believe that it is very important to ensure a consensus based decision -making process. Therefore, we express our readiness to engage constructively in technical work within the framework of the development of the Convention on International Tax Cooperation. I\\u2019m looking fo rward to a productive collaboration in the future. Sincerely yours, Deputy State Secretary Tax, Customs and Accounting issues I. \\u0160\\u0146ucins Riga 15.03.2024.

substantive session of the ad hoc tax committee we thank the chair of the ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference (\\u201ctor\\u201d) for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation (the \\u201ccommittee\\u201d) for the opportunity to provide our inputs to the work of the committee for its first substantive session. the uae supports the un in its goal to achieve inclusive international tax cooperation and reiterates the need for consensus -based decision making and outcomes to ensure effective cooperation is achieved and long -term implementation of all outcomes is possible by all member states. the uae encourages the un to focus on gaps in effective international tax reforms to ensure tax policy makers and administrators efforts are appropriately targeted and to avoid any potential duplication of efforts with other ongoing international tax refor ms. we reiterate the need for the committee to focus on realistic goals and timeframes and i tems of substantive matters . in particular, we highlight the need for the committee to focus on: o strengthening capacity building initiatives to ensure developing countries and least -developed countries can effectively implement both current and future international tax reforms. o minimizing the additional burden on tax administrations and businesses of all international tax reforms. this is important to ensure that the compliance burden for all stakeholders remains as low as possible whilst not hindering the integrity of the policy objectives. o applying efforts in the area of simplification and dispute resolution, for example by way of the application of safe harbors or transitional relief s to complement the above two objectives and give all stakeholders sufficient time to fully comply with the rules. as a partnering jurisdiction with singapore on the committee bureau , we echo singapore\\u2019s comments on the tor document and we reiterate their call for the committee to make use of other organizations (e.g. oecd)  existing platforms (e.g. the platform for collaboration on tax) to provide technical expertise to support the ahc\\u2019s work . in addition, t o ensure that all inputs are considered, and needs addressed, we also request that there is sufficient time for negotiating the convention so that the committee can arrive at practical and well thought through long term solutions that can best serve the collective interests of all member states to ensure coordinated policy objectives are met. conclusion as a country that has recently transitioned from a 2.2. nonominal tax jurisdiction status to a 2.1 jurisdiction and is in the process of undertaking significant domestic and international corporate tax reforms, we reiterate our commitment in sharing knowledge on such important matters and playing a constructive role by bridging differences and building common ground between member states that maybe implementing their own domestic reforms . in addition, a s a partnering bureau member, w e will continue to participate actively in the technical and procedural discussions, and we look forward to collaborating and collectively working towards a draft tor for the framework convention that all member states can support. total: 497 words\",\n          \"ministry of finance of the republic of latvia smil\\u0161u

united nations dear secretariat, i would like to take this opportunity to communicate latvia\\u2019s initial view with regard to development of the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation. first of all, i would like to assure you that latvia fully supports internat ional cooperation to address global challenges, therefore we support the objectives of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation. we believe that the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation could serve to promote an equitable and sustainable approach to international tax cooperation at the global level. we consider that coherence with ongoing work and consensus achieved in the oecd and other international fora is very important, aiming to engage in effective coopera tion to ensure a consistent approach to global tax challenges. therefore, the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation should seek to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary extra budget claims. we also believe that it is very important to ensure a consensus based decision -making process. therefore, we express our readiness to engage constructively in technical work within the framework of the development of the convention on international tax cooperation. i\\u2019m looking fo rward to a productive collaboration in the future. sincerely yours,

efforts at the united nations to make the international tax system more inclusive, equitable and sustainable. we hope to contribute to this objective with the following remarks in preparation of the committee\\u00b4s first substantive session. 1. structural elements of a framework convention 1. decision making modalities : the terms of reference (tors) should indicate that the un convention \\u00b4s decision -making modalities on matters related to its implementation and follow -up will follow the unga procedural rules, exhausting all possible efforts to achieve consensus , but allowing for voting when consensus has not been achieved . in any case, the modalities should not be based on arrangements that favor states lowering standards and sacrificing legitimate aspirations for the sake of consensus . 2. institutional arrangements : 1. cop: in order to guarantee the continuity and the relevance of the agreement, in a context of a rapidly changing economy, the tors should indicate that the un convention will establish a conference of the parties as a decision -making body where all states can constantly meet to update existing standards and agree to further commitments to address emerging tax challenges. 2. subsidiary bodies: the creation of the necessary subsidiary bodies to support intersessional work and advance cop\\u2019s mandates shoul d also be considered , including the potential advisory role of existing un bodies, such as the un committee experts . furthermore, the tor should establish that the un committee of experts on tax matters will serve as an advisory body to the cop, issuing non -binding summaries and advice on the impact of proposed commitments. 3. secretariat: the tors should also announce the establishment of a secretariat and a proper institutional architecture for the implementation of the convention, including its functioning and nature, with responsibilities such as providing technical support to the conference of the parties to facilitate the implementation. the administration, operation, funding , budgetar y matters , and dispute resolution mechanisms for this institutional architecture should be also addressed in the convention. supplementary provisions: the tor may indicate that the un framework convention will include all necessary supplementary provisions to ensure a solid legal grounding for the obligations contained therein. moreover, the tor should establish the need of creating a trust fund to finance the participation of representatives of developing countries during the process of negotiation of the framework convention. 3. principles: a un tax convention should address the large inequalities that have emerged not only between the richest individuals and companies and poorest citizens and legal entities, but also between the taxing powers assigned to traditional residence and source state s. the guiding principle s for a more even distribution of resources and taxing powers should be the progressivity, inclusiveness, fairness , transparency, and ability to pay. ensuring an effective, fair and inclusive governance on tax cooperation, with the meaningful participation of developing countries in decision making and agenda setting , as well as c ontributing to the achievement of the sustainable development goals and future endeavors for the sustainable development agenda, should also be considered as a principle. 4. operational elements: we recognize the critical importance of adopting multilateral solutions to the challenges posed by taxation in a fully globalized, highly digitized economy that currently transcends the traditional notions of physical presence underlying current tax rules. unilateral measures taken by our country at the national level have also shown that the mobility of capital, companies, functions, risks, and assets has reached a point where national borders are inadequate for taxing truly global ta xpayers. we therefore suggest that the tors indicates that the convention will consider the design and implementation of a global corporate income tax based on unitary taxation principles as well as progressive tax measures related to income and wealth taxation of high -net-worth individuals and ultra -high net worth individuals . 5. sustainability : these measures allow countries to pool taxing rights at the global level to mobilize financial resources to fund the new institutional arrangement and to finance global public goods such as climate action. given the global dimension of these challenges, it is appropriate to approve measures that would create the opportunity for ear marked collective international spending. 6. synergies: the tors should indicate that the convention will address synergies and coordination mechanisms in relation to existing tax cooperation efforts and arrangements . 7. enforcement : the tor should mention the need to create a mechanism to verify the fulfill ment of member states\\u00b4 rights and obligations under the convention and protocols . accordingly, the tor should mention the need to create a dispute resolution mechanism in the framework conventio n. 8. capacity building: the tor could mention that a framework convention should enable capacity building of developing countries in tax collection and strengthen international cooperation in this aspect, especially between tax administrations . 2. consideration of simultaneously developing early protocols 9. colombia supports addressing both substantive and procedural elements in the framework convention that could be further developed in early protocols . concrete solutions to materialize the principles mentioned in paragraph 5 should be included in early protocols. in any case, consideration should be given to the timing of the negotiation of early protocols , taking into account the technical capacity and availability of countries, in particular developing countries . 10. in our view, the substantive issues that require urgent detailed commitments are: 1. taxation of high net worth and ultra -high net worth individuals. 2. non pigouvian tax measures to finance climate action, such as a global corporate income tax. 3. measures to curb illicit financial flows related to tax and trade. 4. taxation of services. 5. tax incentives measures to enhance transparency, the exchange of information and mutual administrative assistance . 11. finally, we would like to emphasize on the novel character of the different issues and measures proposed in the paragraphs above. while these proposals may benefit and build upon the achievements of the oecd beps inclusive framework, they include commitmen ts that have not been discussed previously and that could further international tax cooperation in a way that is beneficial to the accomplishment of the sustainable development goals and the raising standards of living for all.\",\n          \"the commonwealth of the bahamas input on un framework

foreign exchange earnings are produced by both tourism and financial services (imf et al. no. 19202, 2019)2, the two main economic pillars (fraser, 2001)3. climate risk jeopardizes national development.4 the united nations ad hoc committee (\\u201cthe committee\\u201d) has been tasked with drafting terms of reference for a un framework convention on international tax cooperation (\\u201cunfcitc \\u201d).5 the convention should init iate a process that increases the legitimacy, stability, resilience, and fairness of international tax rules is in the common interest of all relevant stakeholders . it should establish the legal basis for a fully inclusive and more effective international tax cooperation in terms of substance and process, giving consideration to the value of coherent and consistent international tax rules while also respecting the tax sovereignty of each member state , the unique challenges faced by the commonwealth of the bahamas and other developing countries of the global south . 1. why a un framework convention on international tax cooperation  to promote an inclusive and effective international tax cooperation framework that facilitates the realization of the sustainable development goals (sdgs) consider ing the unique characteristics of the global south .6 2. objectives the convention should set clear objectives inclusive of the following: 1. acknowledge the right of countries to determine their own tax policies 2. tax competition 3. to place developed countries and developing countries on an equally footing 4. take into consideration the unique challenges of developing countries and small island developing states . 5. to combat tax related illicit financial flows 1 francis, r. m., & nair, v.

city, belize. 4 mpo-bhs.pdf (worldbank.org) 5 un tax convention | financing for sustainable development office 6 a.res.78.230english.pdf (un.org) 3 3. substantive elements a) tax competition tax competition is a reality in todays global economy and while it can be beneficial for economic growth and development, it can also create an uneven playing field and lead to harmful tax practices. exchange of information cooperation should recognize the benefits of tax competition while also addressing any potential negative consequences in the following ways: \\u2022 international cooperation and coordination \\u2022 transparency and information exchange \\u2022 reporting requirements \\u2022 focus on fair taxation and administration at a domestic level b) privacy privacy is a crucial aspect of global financial services that must be protected at all costs. this is especially true in the context of beneficial ownership, where the disclosure of such information can have serious implications for both individuals and businesses.7 drawbacks of public registers while the intention behind public beneficial owner registers may be to promote transparency and combat financial crimes, there are significant drawbacks : \\u2022 the violation of client privacy , exposing individuals and their assets to potential risks such as identity theft, fraud, kidnapping, and extortion. \\u2022 potential harm to the reputation and business interests of legitimate companies and individuals who wish to keep their financial affairs confidential. \\u2022 costly and burdensome process. alternatives to public registers the framework should consider alternatives to public beneficial owner registers: \\u2022 centralized registers accessible only to competent authorities (i.e., law enforcement agencies, tax authorities, and financial intelligence units ). \\u2022 strengthening existing know your customer (kyc) and anti -money laundering (aml) laws that are universally applied . 7 2022-03-10-ground-breaking-civil-society-proposal -for-a-un-en-pdf.pdf (globaltaxjustice.org) 4 c) tax preferences , investment incentives and free trade zones tax preferences and investment incentives the use of tax preferences and incentives can be an effective tool for attracting investment and promoting economic growth. however, they can lead to base erosion and profit shifting. the unfcitc should address the use of tax preferences and investment incentives . it should require the use of tax preferences and incentives in a transparent and fair manner in the following ways : \\u2022 defined eligibility criteria \\u2022 non-discriminat ory granting of preferences \\u2022 transparency of information on availability of tax preferences and incentives \\u2022 monitoring and evaluat ion of the impact of tax preferences and incentives \\u2022 compliance enforcement with the rules free trade zones free trade zones (ftzs) have been established to promote international trade by providing special economic and trade incentives to businesses. the unfcitc should acknowledge the benefit of ftzs whilst including mechanisms to mitigate beps (i.e., strengthening domestic tax laws and regulations , disclosure requirements cooperation between competent authorities , monitoring, and reporting ). d) transfer pricing today transfer pricing is a crucial aspect of the global economy. the un framework convention should consider : \\u2022 the effectiveness of transfer pricing r ules \\u2022 the need to d evelop rules which consider the differences in local markets and economic conditions \\u2022 the need for easily enforceable rules \\u2022 the challenge of double taxation \\u2022 the need for flexibility when companies are allocating costs and profits consider alternatives to transfer pricing rules the un framework convention should consider alternatives including but not limited to the following: a) formulary apportionment b) unitary taxation c) advance pricing agreements d) digital taxation 5 arm\\u2019s length principle the current international tax system is based on the \\u201carm\\u2019s length principle,\\u201d which states that transactions between related parties should be conducted at market prices. however, this principle is outdated and inadequate in addressing the tax challenges posed by the group structure of multinational entities (mnes). to mitigate manipulation of the arm\\u2019s length principle, the following measures should be considered: \\u2022 reconsider transfer pricing rules (above) \\u2022 a process for t he exchange of information between tax authorities \\u2022 the use of digital taxation as a means to address the issue of taxing rights between countries e) environmental taxation recognition of environmental taxes ( i.e., carbon tax ). one of the main benefits of carbon taxes is that they provide a clear financial incentive for companies and individuals to reduce their carbon emissions. this can lead to innovative solutions and technological advancements in clean energy and other sustainable practices . the tax can also help level the playing field for renewable energy sources, making them more competitive with fossil fuels . a carbon tax also levels the playing field between high emitting developed countries and low emitting developing countries. f) equitable distribution of taxing rights the current distribution of taxing rights is inequitable , with developed countries holding a significant advantage over the global south . the un framework convention should facilitate the following: \\u2022 a more collaborative and inclusive approach to international tax policymaking , with active participation of developing countries. \\u2022 a re-evaluation of the current tax treaties between developed and developing countries. these treaties are often drafted in favor of developed countries \\u2022 a focus on domestic tax policies in developing countries \\u2022 a focus on the unique challenges faced by developed countries including the impact of the climate c risis and resources needed to achieve the un sustainable development goals. 4. procedural elements a) key committees and permanent secretariat the unfcitc should establish key committees and a permanent secretariat to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the convention. the committees 6 should include representatives from all member countries and should have the authority to make decisions and recommendations. the structure of the secretariat should be considered as well as how it will interact with other un bodies. there may be an opportunity to engage with the existing un technical tax committee of experts and entities related to these specific international tax matters as an advisory body and mediator for the cop . b) agenda setting all count ries should have input on the agenda of the various committees. th e agenda should reflect the needs and concerns of all stakeholders and aim to priorities and address the identified issues in a fair and equitable manner. c) decision -making process the convention should adopt a majority voting system. this will allow for timely and effective decision making, while also considering the views of all member countries. a conference of parties (cop) should also be considered in the decision -making process8, providing a platfor m for countries to discuss and negotiate issues and provide updates on progress being made to implement the convention. d) voting rights voting rights should be allocated fairly among all member countries. this will ensure that all countries have a both a vote and voice in the decision -making process. e) enforcement protocols effective enforcement protocols are essential for the successful implementation of any international tax framework. these protocols should include mechanisms for resolving disputes between countries, as well as penalties for non -compliance. diplomacy shoul d also play a crucial role in resolving tax disputes between countries. elimination of blacklists blacklists, which are lists of countries deemed to be non -cooperative in tax matters, have been a source of contention in international tax cooperation. the unfcitc should aim to eliminate the use of blacklists and instead focus on promoting cooperation and transparency among countries. \\u2022 blacklists unfairly target developing countries, often without taking into account their unique economic and social contexts . 8 tcpb21streamlining -the-architecture -of-international -tax-through-a-un-framework -convention -on-tax- cooperationen.pdf (southcentre.int) 7 \\u2022 blacklists have a severe impact on a countrys economy, discouraging foreign investment and trade \\u2022 the listing process is subjective and biased. countries can be placed on the blacklist without a clear explanation, with little opportunity for them to defend themselves, damaging their international reputation and credibility. \\u2022 developing countries often lack capacity and the blacklisting process does not provide any support or assistance in this regard. \\u2022 blacklists breach our lawful right to development. f) a simplified tax administration system a simplified tax administration system could incorporate the following: \\u2022 standardised tax treaty provisions \\u2022 an inclusive body for dialogue on tax matters ( i.e. conference of parties) \\u2022 protocols and codes of conduct \\u2022 a multilateral instrument g) dispute resolution a comprehensive dispute resolution system should incorporate various methods and tools to effectively resolve conflicts and maintain peace. diplomacy, negotiation, and dialogue between competent authorities can be utilized to promote understanding and find mutually agreeable solutions. in cases where a neutral third party is needed; arbitration and conciliation can be employed to facilitate a fair and binding decision. as a final resort, the international court of justice can serve as an option for dispute settlement. this will ensure a multi -faceted approach to dispute resolution. h) technical assistance and capacity building mechanisms for technical assistance, knowledge sharing, and capacity building should be included in the unfcitc . this will help countries of the global south to develop and strengthen institutional and technical capacities to promote sustainable economic growth consistent with the sdgs. conclusion the unfcitc should include both substantive and procedural elements in order to effectively address the challenges of international taxation. in this regard, we have encouraged the input of stakeholders in the bahamian economy which has been submitted directly to the committee . the bahamas submits that the convention should recognize the benefits of tax competition while also addressing illicit financial flows. these issues can be addressed in the initial protocols.\",\n          \"brazil - inputs - draft terms of reference for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation brazil welcomes and is pleased to respond to the call for inputs of the secretariat of the ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation . we commend the un for its commitment to shaping a fair, transparent, and efficient international tax system that supports the sdgs and fosters global economic growth , stability , and the reduction of inequalities . in the call for inputs, the secretariat asked to refer to the following guiding question for the committee\\u2019s deliberations and preparations: \\u201cwhat are some specific problems that could be addressed by a un framework convention on international tax cooperation\\u201d against this backdrop, brazil submits the following considerations: i - decision -making process : this subject has been raised by different countries , and we want to use this opportunity to emphasize that t he tor of the united na tions framework conven tion on interna tional tax coopera tion (unfcitc ) should address the decision -making process to be used in the unfcitc , as well as in its anne xes. in this regard, the tor s hould present the guidelines to be used in the absence of consensus in a reasonable timeline , including the use of the majority vo ting system, and define \\u201ca reasonable time line\\u201d. ii - structure in relation to the drafting of the unfcitc , brazil understands that the tor should address possible structures , working rules and composition of subsidiary and technical groups . it is also important to define in the tor the final choice among different models of working bodies or technical groups to draft the unfcitc and the early protocols . inclusi veness and transparency must be key principles in their functioning . we believe that technical groups to discuss the early protocols should focus on specific topics even if the broader coordination or the initial approval of the initial draft of such protocols to the unfcitc can be attributed to one body. we are of the view that delegates of the subsidiary bodies or technical groups , including those in charge of the discuss ion of e arly protocols , should work in their capacity as government representatives. among the subsidiary bodies, we must consider during the tor discussions whether the unfcitc should establish monitoring bodies to assess the implementation of the protocols to the unfcitc. additionally, the tor should address whether the unfcitc would establish other types of instruments or recommendations ( other than the protocols ) instead of, or in ad dition to, issuing protocols for topics that are discussed in other forums or that at that moment could not be addressed in a protocol. iii \\u2013 substantive scope we understand that there are various topics of interest that are typically dealt with in double taxation agreements or other instruments that could be considered in protocols to the unfcitc. brazil understands that we should work on early protocols simult aneously to the drafting of the unfcitc. in relation to the substantive scope of the unfcitc to be framed in the tor, at this stage, we must take into consideration the limited capacity of countries for simultaneous discussion s of many topics or early protocols. against this backdrop , brazil suggests focusing on a selected number of subjects for the early protocols while keeping a flexible framework in the unfcitc to be able to incorporate new subjects in the future. in this regard , we suggest the following issues to be discussed in the early protocols : 1. taxation o f super -rich individuals ; 2. illicit financial flows; 3. taxation of cross -border services ; 4. global cooperation on the efficiency of tax benefits iv - consideration of simultaneously developing early protocols brazil understands that the prioritization of the themes or topics for the early protocols should be discussed by the ad hoc committee in the tor drafting process. besides, we have to consider that some of the topics that have been raised for the early protocols are too broad and we must specify or delineate them in a feasible approach .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

provide our inputs to the work of the committee for its first substantive session. the uae supports the un in its goal to achieve inclusive international tax cooperation and reiterates the need for consensus -based decision making and outcomes to ensure effective cooperation is achieved and long -term implementation of all outcomes is possible by all member states. the uae encourages the un to focus on gaps in effective international tax reforms to ensure tax policy makers and administrators efforts are appropriately targeted and to avoid any potential duplication of efforts with other ongoing international tax refor ms. we reiterate the need for the committee to focus on realistic goals and timeframes and i tems of substantive matters . in particular, we highlight the need for the committee to focus on: o strengthening capacity building initiatives to ensure developing countries and least -developed countries can effectively implement both current and future international tax reforms. o minimizing the additional burden on tax administrations and businesses of all international tax reforms. this is important to ensure that the compliance burden for all stakeholders remains as low as possible whilst not hindering the integrity of the policy objectives. o applying efforts in the area of simplification and dispute resolution, for example by way of the application of safe harbors or transitional relief s to complement the above two objectives and give all stakeholders sufficient time to fully comply with the rules. as a partnering jurisdiction with singapore on the committee bureau , we echo singapore\\u2019s comments on the tor document and we reiterate their call for the committee to make use of other organizations (e.g. oecd)  existing platforms (e.g. the platform for collaboration on tax) to provide technical expertise to support the ahc\\u2019s work . in addition, t o ensure that all inputs are considered, and needs addressed, we also request that there is sufficient time for negotiating the convention so that the committee can arrive at practical and well thought through long term solutions that can best serve the collective interests of all member states to ensure coordinated policy objectives are met. conclusion as a country that has recently transitioned from a 2.2. nonominal tax jurisdiction status to a 2.1 jurisdiction and is in the process of undertaking significant domestic and international corporate tax reforms, we reiterate our commitment in sharing knowledge on such important matters and playing a constructive role by bridging differences and building common ground between member states that maybe implementing their own domestic reforms . in addition, a s a partnering bureau member, w e will continue to participate actively in the technical and procedural discussions, and we look forward to collaborating and collectively working towards a draft tor for the framework convention that all member states can support.

initial view with regard to development of the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation. first of all, i would like to assure you that latvia fully supports internat ional cooperation to address global challenges, therefore we support the objectives of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation. we believe that the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation could serve to promote an equitable and sustainable approach to international tax cooperation at the global level. we consider that coherence with ongoing work and consensus achieved in the oecd and other international fora is very important, aiming to engage in effective coopera tion to ensure a consistent approach to global tax challenges. therefore, the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation should seek to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary extra budget claims. we also believe that it is very important to ensure a consensus based decision -making process. therefore, we express our readiness to engage constructively in technical work within the framework of the development of the convention on international tax

(b) taxation of offshore indirect transfers the framework convention should address the imbalance in the distribution of taxing rights over gains from the alienation of shares and comparable interest s where they derive their value from immovable property located within a jurisdiction or from the capital of a company iso 9001:2015 certified internal resident in that jurisdiction. developing countries have had a difficult time negotiating the inclusion of these provisions within tax treaties while this is clearly income that is derived from those jurisdictions. in addressing the areas above, the framework convention should include a protocol that would ensure the adoption of these taxing rights into existing tax treaties which contain the imbalance in distribution of ta xing rights. there should also be a provision for assistance in collection of taxes and effective exchange of information among member states because the recipients of the income will not be resident in the source jurisdiction. 2. combating of illicit financial flows. the framework convention should promote the fight against illicit financial flows by increasing transparency and cooperation between governments and by creating more coherent and less complex global tax rules and standards. the current exchange of information standard is flawed because a number of the key economic players are exploiting loopholes within the standard to not share the information requested by another country. the standard is also not globally implemented therefore information cannot be requested from large economies that have companies operating within many other jurisdictions. the uptake of this standard has also been slow among developing countries because of the high capacity and infrastructure costs associated with being able to receive the required information. the framework convention should address this by developing policies that will take into consideration the different capabilities of member states and ensuring that there will be global adoption of the policies to ensure effective implementation. 3. international cooperation on assistance in collection of tax debt . cross -border assistance in the recovery of taxes is crucial especially for developing countries who rely heavily on tax revenues for their national budget. the recovery of unpaid taxes in the cross -border context has been a challenge for kenya mainly because key economic partners have placed reservations against the implementation of the standards that would have allowed for this assistance. the framework convention should develop a policy that will ensure effective international cooperation in the recovery of tax debt. it should also provide for technical assistance to ensure that proper structures and resources are developed for the management of cross -border tax collection. iso 9001:2015 certified internal 4. reduction in complexity in tax rules, especially in taxation of cross - border transactions. the current rules on taxation of cross -border transactions were developed without considering the different circumstances of the countries that are implementing them. an example is in transfer pricing whereby implementation of the arm\\u2019s length principle requires the use of comparables and access to platforms that would provide the necessary data. many developing countries do not have local comparables or the resources required to access the necessary data. the framework convention should develop common tax policies in this area that can be tailor -made and adapted according to the specific needs of countries or regions. the new system could allocate taxing rights between governments based on an agreed formula supplemented by a minimum effective corporate tax rate and minimum amount of tax on cross -border payments whether base eroding or not. 5. reconsideration of recently developed international tax policies that affect countries which were not involved in their formulation. kenya has been among a number of countries that have raised concerns around recently developed international tax policies because of the ir complexity and failure to consider the unique concerns of developing countries. the framework convention should review these policies on a platform with more inclusive participation and consider the concerns and priorities of all countries, especially those who would be adversely affected by these policies but were not included in their development. 6. promotion of government accountability on tax expenditure. the framework convention has the opportunity to create a policy that would promote government accountability and transparency on tax expenditure. many countries are unable to hold their governments accountable on the revenue collected within the jurisdiction which has led to misuse of funds and a decline in the provision of public services . the convention should call on governments to commit to transparency and accountability on expenditure of revenue which will in turn ensure that they allocate the resources in the best interests of the country and meet their sustainable development goals. 7. dispute prevention and resolution. a majority of developing countries do not implement policies on advance pricing arrangements and mandatory binding arbitration as tools for enhancing dispute prevention and resolution. the main reasons for this include low capacity and expertise to effectively implement those tools , the high costs associated with implementing them and the impartiality of the arbitrators who would mostly come from developed countries. iso 9001:2015 certified internal the framework convention should develop dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms that can be implemented on an equal footing taking into account the unique circumstances of each region . it should also provide for robust capacity building to developing countries in these areas to ensure that they have the required capability and resources to effectively implement these tools. 8. capacity building . in addition to the above, the framework convention should contain provisions on tailor -made capacity building to member states to ensure that their unique needs and priorities are met. capacity building is sometimes done without focusing on the specific priorities of countries and on tax policies that they did not take part in formulating. it is crucial for the framework convention to offer need -based capacity building to member states so that all the technical policies that will be developed can have wide and effective implementation. 9. carbon trading. the framework convention aims to promote progressive tax systems and link global tax governance and other governmental commitments and obligations, including those relating to environmental protection. to achieve this, t he framework convention should develop policies promoting international cooperation and transparency to ensure effective regulati on of the trade of carbon credits. this is a market that is difficult to track and regulate because it lacks transparency and operates on both compliance and volun tary basis. international cooperation and transparency would ensure that once a carbon credit is transferred out of one jurisdiction to another, it should not be claimed in the first jurisdiction. it would also prevent the risk of financial fraud and money laundering through this market. capacity building in this area will be crucial to ensure effective administration, monitoring and verification.\",\n

effective practices on mobilising domestic resources through both tax policy formulation and the strengthen ing of enforcement mechanisms. this effort underscores the pivotal role of the un in supporting un member states to mobilise domestic revenues and finance development strategies, aligning closely with the aspirations outlined in general assembly resolution 78230. consistency with ongoing work and consensus achieved in the oecd and other international fora (such as the inclusive framework on beps and the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes) should be a guiding principle, aiming to build on these strengths and engage in effective cooperation to ensure a synergistic approach to global tax challenges. the convention should seek to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary extra budget claims, advocating for a decision -making process that strives for consensus. this effort should also seek to ensure that these endeavours are in line with the sustainable development goals (sdgs), promoting a more equitable and sustainable approach to international tax cooperation. the work should therefore start with a thorough an alysis of issues that strengthen the inclusiveness and effectiveness and that support the sustainable development goals and domestic resource mobilisation. belgium looks forward to working with the secretariat and the other member states and stakeholders to create a stronger and more inclusive international tax system and we are very thankful for the opportunity to participate in shaping this new global instrument.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"total_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

of the ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference (\\u201ctor\\u201d) for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation (the \\u201ccommittee\\u201d) for the opportunity to provide our inputs to the work of the committee for its first substantive session. the uae supports the un in its goal to achieve inclusive international tax cooperation and reiterates the need for consensus -based decision making and outcomes to ensure effective cooperation is achieved and long -term implementation of all outcomes is possible by all member states. the uae encourages the un to focus on gaps in effective international tax reforms to ensure tax policy makers and administrators efforts are appropriately targeted and to avoid any potential duplication of efforts with other ongoing international tax refor ms. we reiterate the need for the committee to focus on realistic goals and timeframes and i tems of substantive matters . in particular, we highlight the need for the committee to focus on: o strengthening capacity building initiatives to ensure developing countries and least -developed countries can effectively implement both current and future international tax reforms. o minimizing the additional burden on tax administrations and businesses of all international tax reforms. this is important to ensure that the compliance burden for all stakeholders remains as low as possible whilst not hindering the integrity of the policy objectives. o applying efforts in the area of simplification and dispute resolution, for example by way of the application of safe harbors or transitional relief s to complement the above two objectives and give all stakeholders sufficient time to fully comply with the rules. as a partnering jurisdiction with singapore on the committee bureau , we echo singapore\\u2019s comments on the tor document and we reiterate their call for the committee to make use of other organizations (e.g. oecd)  existing platforms (e.g. the

ahc-tax@un.org subject: promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the united nations dear secretariat, i would like to take this opportunity to communicate latvia\\u2019s initial view with regard to development of the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation. first of all, i would like to assure you that latvia fully supports internat ional cooperation to address global challenges, therefore we support the objectives of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation. we believe that the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation could serve to promote an equitable and sustainable approach to international tax cooperation at the global level. we consider that coherence with ongoing work and consensus achieved in the oecd and other international fora is very important, aiming to engage in effective coopera tion to ensure a consistent approach to global tax challenges. therefore, the united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation should seek to avoid duplication of work and unnecessary extra budget claims. we also believe that it is very important to ensure a consensus based decision -making process. therefore, we express our readiness to engage constructively in technical work within the framework of the development of the convention on international tax cooperation. i\\u2019m looking fo rward to a productive collaboration in the future. sincerely yours, deputy state secretary tax, customs and accounting issues i. \\u0161\\u0146ucins riga 15.03.2024.

ways to further enhance \\u201cinclusiveness \\u201d and \\u201ceffectiveness \\u201d of such cooperation. t\\u00fcrkiye has been a keen supporter of un \\u2019s efforts to this end . we believe that the un should play an active role in this field, while keeping its focus on the developing countries . t\\u00fcrkiye , since the beginning of the process, has been of the view that international tax cooperation should be carried out in the form of a non-binding (optional) framework . yet, we will engage in the work of the ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation . on the way ahead, t\\u00fcrkiye strongly believes that years of experience and success of oecd in this field should not go unnoticed . we believe that the vast experience and knowledge of oecd must be seriously considered in the work of the ad hoc committee . in this regard, the ad hoc committee should explore options to further improve already existing frameworks and instruments . we believe that international tax cooperation could be strengthened further only by leveraging existing arrangements in this field, through which optimal use of limited resources could also be ensured . in line with the explanation above, and considering the intensive work that the oecd has undertaken over the years to address the comprehensive set of problems in the field of international tax coope ration, we would be pleased if we could further understand additional benefits that could and expected to be achieved through a un framework convention.\"\n

the un should play an active role in this field, while keeping its focus on the developing countries . t\\u00fcrkiye , since the beginning of the process, has been of the view that international tax cooperation should be carried out in the form of a non-binding (optional) framework . yet, we will engage in the work of the ad hoc committee to draft terms of reference for a united nations framework convention on international tax cooperation . on the way ahead, t\\u00fcrkiye strongly believes that years of experience and success of oecd in this field should not go unnoticed . we believe that the vast experience and knowledge of oecd must be seriously considered in the work of the ad hoc committee . in this regard, the ad hoc committee should explore options to further improve already existing frameworks and instruments . we believe that international tax cooperation could be strengthened further only by leveraging existing arrangements in this field, through which optimal use of limited resources could also be ensured . in line with the explanation above, and considering the intensive work that the oecd has undertaken over the years to address the comprehensive set of problems in the field of international tax coope ration, we would be pleased if we could further understand additional benefits that could and expected to be achieved through a un framework convention.\"\n
